  * What Is MSXML?
    * Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) allows customers to build high-performance XML-based applications that provide a high degree of interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard.
    * Among the core services MSXML provides is developer support for the following:
    * The Document Object Model (DOM), a standard library of application programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing XML documents.
    * Helper APIs to assist with programming for the XML namespace or the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) when it is used to send data directly between Web servers.
    * XML Schema Definition (XSD). Earlier MSXML versions such as MSXML 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 as support the XML Data Reduced schema definition language (XDR), which was introduced by Microsoft to support XML schema working needs before XSD became a W3C standard. Support for XDR is removed from MSXML 6.0.
    * The Simple API for XML (SAX), a programmatic alternative to DOM-based processing.
    * The Schema Object Model (SOM), an additional set of APIs for accessing XML Schema documents programmatically that was available in MSXML 4.0 and later.
    * XML Digital Signatures support, which provides the ability to sign and verify XML document data through digital encryption. This support is only available in MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office Applications.
* [MSXML - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSXML)
  * Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) are set of services that allow applications written in JScript, VBScript, and Microsoft development tools to build Windows-native XML-based applications. It supports XML 1.0, DOM, SAX, an XSLT 1.0 processor, XML schema support including XSD and XDR, as well as other XML-related technologies.
* [IXMLDOMParseError | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms757019(v=vs.85))
  * Returns detailed information about the last parse error, including the error number, line number, character position, and a text description.
