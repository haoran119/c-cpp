* [Windows API - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API)
  * The Windows API, informally WinAPI, is Microsoft's core set of application programming interfaces (APIs) available in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. The name Windows API collectively refers to several different platform implementations that are often referred to by their own names (for example, Win32 API); see the versions section. Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API. On the Windows NT line of operating systems, a small number (such as programs started early in the Windows startup process) use the Native API.[1]
  * Developer support is available in the form of a software development kit, Microsoft Windows SDK, providing documentation and tools needed to build software based on the Windows API and associated Windows interfaces.
  * The Windows API (Win32) is focused mainly on the programming language C[2] in that its exposed functions and data structures are described in that language in recent versions of its documentation. However, the API may be used by any programming language compiler or assembler able to handle the (well-defined) low-level data structures along with the prescribed calling conventions for calls and callbacks. Similarly, the internal implementation of the API's function has been developed in several languages, historically.[3] Despite the fact that C is not an object-oriented programming language, the Windows API and Windows have both historically been described as object-oriented. There have also been many wrapper classes and extensions (from Microsoft and others) for object-oriented languages that make this object-oriented structure more explicit (Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC), Visual Component Library (VCL), GDI+, etc.). For instance, Windows 8 provides the Windows API and the WinRT API, which is implemented in C++[4] and is object-oriented by design.[4]

## ATL & MFC

* [Microsoft C/C++ Documentation | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-160)
  * [ATL COM Desktop Components | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl/atl-com-desktop-components?view=msvc-160)
    * The ATL Reference documents the `Active Template Library (ATL)`, a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a binary specification for creating and consuming software components on Windows. To fully take advantage of ATL, a working familiarity with COM is highly recommended. For more information about COM, see Component Object Model (COM).
    * [Active Template Library (ATL) Concepts | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts?view=msvc-160)
      * The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes that let you create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls.
      * If you do a lot of ATL programming, you will want to learn more about COM and .NET attributes, which is designed to simplify COM programming. For more information, see Attributed Programming. (COM and .NET attributes are not to be confused with the [[attribute]] feature in the C++ standard.)
  * [MFC Desktop Applications | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/mfc-desktop-applications?view=msvc-160)
    * The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library provides an object-oriented wrapper over much of the Win32 and COM APIs. Although it can be used to create very simple desktop applications, it is most useful when you need to develop more complex user interfaces with multiple controls. You can use MFC to create applications with Office-style user interfaces. For documentation on the Windows platform itself, see Windows documentation. For information on building Windows applications in C++ without MFC, see Build desktop Windows apps using the Win32 API.

* [CComVariant class | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl/reference/ccomvariant-class?view=msvc-170)
  * This class wraps the VARIANT type, providing a member indicating the type of data stored.
  * [VARIANT (oaidl.h) - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oaidl/ns-oaidl-variant)
    * VARIANTARG describes arguments passed within DISPPARAMS, and VARIANT to specify variant data that cannot be passed by reference.
    * When a variant refers to another variant by using the VT_VARIANT | VT_BYREF vartype, the variant being referred to cannot also be of type VT_VARIANT | VT_BYREF. VARIANTs can be passed by value, even if VARIANTARGs cannot.
* [Using CString | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl-mfc-shared/using-cstring?view=msvc-160)
  * The topics in this section describe how to program with CString. For reference documentation about the CString class, see the documentation for CStringT.
  * To use CString, include the atlstr.h header.
  * The CString, CStringA, and CStringW classes are specializations of a class template called CStringT based on the type of character data they support.
  * A CStringW object contains the wchar_t type and supports Unicode strings. A CStringA object contains the char type, and supports single-byte and multi-byte (MBCS) strings. A CString object supports either the char type or the wchar_t type, depending on whether the MBCS symbol or the UNICODE symbol is defined at compile time.
  * A CString object keeps character data in a CStringData object. CString accepts NULL-terminated C-style strings. CString tracks the string length for faster performance, but it also retains the NULL character in the stored character data to support conversion to LPCWSTR. CString includes the null terminator when it exports a C-style string. You can insert a NULL at other locations in a CString, but it may produce unexpected results.
  * The following set of string classes can be used without linking an MFC library, with or without CRT support: CAtlString, CAtlStringA, and CAtlStringW.
  * CString is used in native projects. For managed-code (C++/CLI) projects, use System::String.
  * To add more capabilities than CString, CStringA, or CStringW currently offer, you should create a subclass of CStringT that contains the additional features.

## COM

* [`Component Object Model (COM)` - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal)
  * Purpose
    * COM is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents) and ActiveX (Internet-enabled components) technologies.
  * Where applicable
    * COM objects can be created with a variety of programming languages. Object-oriented languages, such as C++, provide programming mechanisms that simplify the implementation of COM objects. These objects can be within a single process, in other processes, even on remote computers.
* [Component Object Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model)
  * Component Object Model (COM) is a binary-interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It is used to enable inter-process communication object creation in a large range of programming languages. COM is the basis for several other Microsoft technologies and frameworks, including OLE, OLE Automation, Browser Helper Object, ActiveX, COM+, DCOM, the Windows shell, DirectX, UMDF and Windows Runtime. The essence of COM is a language-neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one in which they were created, even across machine boundaries. For well-authored components, COM allows reuse of objects with no knowledge of their internal implementation, as it forces component implementers to provide well-defined interfaces that are separated from the implementation. The different allocation semantics of languages are accommodated by making objects responsible for their own creation and destruction through reference-counting. Type conversion casting between different interfaces of an object is achieved through the QueryInterface method. The preferred method of "inheritance" within COM is the creation of sub-objects to which method "calls" are delegated.
  * COM is an interface technology defined and implemented as standard only on Microsoft Windows and Apple's Core Foundation 1.3 and later plug-in application programming interface (API).[1] The latter only implements a subset of the whole COM interface.[2] For some applications, COM has been replaced at least to some extent by the Microsoft .NET framework, and support for Web Services through the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). However, COM objects can be used with all .NET languages through .NET COM Interop. Networked DCOM uses binary proprietary formats, while WCF encourages the use of XML-based SOAP messaging. COM is very similar to other component software interface technologies, such as CORBA and Enterprise JavaBeans, although each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Unlike C++, COM provides a stable application binary interface (ABI) that does not change between compiler releases.[3] This makes COM interfaces attractive for object-oriented C++ libraries that are to be used by clients compiled using different compiler versions.
* [Is component object model still used?](https://livebook.manning.com/book/powershell-in-depth-second-edition/chapter-34/)
  * .NET Framework, folks relied on an earlier technology called the Component Object Model (COM). COM is basically a set of rules that enable developers to write software components that can easily interoperate. COM is still in wide use today, although it's considered an older cousin to the . NET Framework.

  * DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANAGED AND UNMANAGED CODE?
    * Managed code is the one that is executed by the CLR of the .NET framework while unmanaged or unsafe code is executed by the operating system.
    * The managed code provides security to the code while undamaged code creates security threats.
    * In unsafe or unmanaged code the unsafe modifier is used to write the block of code while any other code written outside the unsafe code block is managed code.
    * Memory buffer overflow problems do not occur in managed code as it is taken care of by the runtime environment but these problems occur in unmanaged code.
    * Runtime services are provided in managed code while they are not provided in unmanaged code.
    * Source code is first converted to intermediate language and then to native language in managed code while it is directly converted into the native language in unmanaged code.
    * Unmanaged code provides low-level access while managed code does not provide that.
    * In unsafe or unmanaged code the unsafe modifier is used to write the block of code while any other code written outside the unsafe code block is managed code.
* [Compiler COM Support | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/compiler-com-support?view=msvc-160)
  * The Microsoft C++ compiler can directly read component object model (COM) type libraries and translate the contents into C++ source code that can be included in the compilation. Language extensions are available to facilitate COM programming on the client side for desktop apps.
  * By using the #import preprocessor directive, the compiler can read a type library and convert it into a C++ header file that describes the COM interfaces as classes. A set of #import attributes is available for user control of the content for the resulting type library header files.
  * You can use the __declspec extended attribute uuid to assign a globally unique identifier (GUID) to a COM object. The keyword __uuidof can be used to extract the GUID associated with a COM object. Another __declspec attribute, property, can be used to specify the get and set methods for a data member of a COM object.
  * A set of COM support global functions and classes is provided to support the VARIANT and BSTR types, implement smart pointers, and encapsulate the error object thrown by _com_raise_error:
    * Compiler COM Global Functions
    * _bstr_t
    * _com_error
    * _com_ptr_t
    * _variant_t
  * [BSTR | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/automat/bstr)
    * A BSTR (Basic string or binary string) is a string data type that is used by COM, Automation, and Interop functions. Use the BSTR data type in all interfaces that will be accessed from script.
  * [_bstr_t class | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/bstr-t-class?view=msvc-160)
    * A _bstr_t object encapsulates the BSTR data type. The class manages resource allocation and deallocation through function calls to SysAllocString and SysFreeString and other BSTR APIs when appropriate. The _bstr_t class uses reference counting to avoid excessive overhead.
  * [_bstr_t::operator +=, _bstr_t::operator + | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/bstr-t-operator-add-equal-plus?view=msvc-160)
    * Appends characters to the end of the _bstr_t object, or concatenates two strings.
  * [_bstr_t::wchar_t*, _bstr_t::char* | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/bstr-t-wchar-t-star-bstr-t-char-star?view=msvc-160)
    * Returns the BSTR characters as a narrow or wide character array.
* [CoInitialize function (objbase.h) - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/objbase/nf-objbase-coinitialize)
  * Initializes the COM library on the current thread and identifies the concurrency model as single-thread apartment (STA).
  * New applications should call CoInitializeEx instead of CoInitialize.
  * If you want to use the Windows Runtime, you must call Windows::Foundation::Initialize instead.
* [CoUninitialize function (combaseapi.h) - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-couninitialize)
  * Closes the COM library on the current thread, unloads all DLLs loaded by the thread, frees any other resources that the thread maintains, and forces all RPC connections on the thread to close.
* [HRESULT - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRESULT)
  * In the field of computer programming, the HRESULT is a data type used in Windows operating systems, and the earlier IBM/Microsoft OS/2 operating system, to represent error conditions, and warning conditions.
  * The original purpose of HRESULTs was to formally lay out ranges of error codes for both public and Microsoft internal use in order to prevent collisions between error codes in different subsystems of the OS/2 operating system.
  * HRESULTs are numerical error codes. Various bits within an HRESULT encode information about the nature of the error code, and where it came from.
  * HRESULT error codes are most commonly encountered in COM programming, where they form the basis for a standardized COM error handling convention.
  * [HRESULT | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/hresult)
    * The following HRESULT values are the most common. More values are contained in the header file Winerror.h.

* [Universally unique identifier - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
  * A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit label used for information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used, often in software created by Microsoft.[1]
  * When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are, for practical purposes, unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other numbering schemes. While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.[2][3]
  * Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.
  * Adoption of UUIDs is widespread, with many computing platforms providing support for generating them and for parsing their textual representation.
  * [GUID - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/guiddef/ns-guiddef-guid)
    * A GUID identifies an object such as a COM interfaces, or a COM class object, or a manager entry-point vector (EPV). A GUID is a 128-bit value consisting of one group of 8 hexadecimal digits, followed by three groups of 4 hexadecimal digits each, followed by one group of 12 hexadecimal digits. The following example GUID shows the groupings of hexadecimal digits in a GUID: 6B29FC40-CA47-1067-B31D-00DD010662DA.

## MSXML

* [MSXML SDK Overview | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms760399(v=vs.85))
  * What Is MSXML?
    * `Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)` allows customers to build high-performance XML-based applications that provide a high degree of interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard.
    * Among the core services MSXML provides is developer support for the following:
    * The Document Object Model (DOM), a standard library of application programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing XML documents.
    * Helper APIs to assist with programming for the XML namespace or the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) when it is used to send data directly between Web servers.
    * XML Schema Definition (XSD). Earlier MSXML versions such as MSXML 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 as support the XML Data Reduced schema definition language (XDR), which was introduced by Microsoft to support XML schema working needs before XSD became a W3C standard. Support for XDR is removed from MSXML 6.0.
    * The Simple API for XML (SAX), a programmatic alternative to DOM-based processing.
    * The Schema Object Model (SOM), an additional set of APIs for accessing XML Schema documents programmatically that was available in MSXML 4.0 and later.
    * XML Digital Signatures support, which provides the ability to sign and verify XML document data through digital encryption. This support is only available in MSXML 5.0 for Microsoft Office Applications.
* [MSXML - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSXML)

## [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

* [PowerShell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
    * PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management program from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language. Initially a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on August 18, 2016, with the introduction of PowerShell Core.[5] The former is built on the .NET Framework, the latter on .NET (previously .NET Core).
    * Since Windows 10 build 14971, PowerShell replaced Command Prompt and became the default command shell for File Explorer.[6][7]
    * In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed via cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the file system or Windows Registry, which are made available to PowerShell via providers. Third-party developers can add cmdlets and providers to PowerShell.[8][9] Cmdlets may be used by scripts, which may in turn be packaged into modules. Cmdlets work in tandem with the .NET API.
    * PowerShell's support for .NET Remoting, WS-Management, CIM, and SSH enables administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems. PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications. These applications can then use PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations, including those exposed via the graphical interface. This capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets.[8][10] Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets.[11]
    * PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help (similar to man pages in Unix shells) accessible via the Get-Help cmdlet. Updated local help contents can be retrieved from the Internet via the Update-Help cmdlet. Alternatively, help from the web can be acquired on a case-by-case basis via the -online switch to Get-Help.

#### Test-Path

* Test-Path in powershell ?
    * In PowerShell, Test-Path is a cmdlet that allows you to determine if a particular path (like a file or a folder) exists. This can be useful in scripts or functions where you need to take different actions based on the presence or absence of a file or folder.
    * Basic Usage:
        * `Test-Path -Path "C:\path\to\your\file_or_folder"`
        * If the path exists, it will return $true. Otherwise, it will return $false.
    * Examples:
        * Check if a file exists:
            * `Test-Path -Path "C:\Users\Username\Documents\example.txt"`
        * Check if a directory exists:
            * `Test-Path -Path "C:\Users\Username\Documents\ExampleFolder"`
        * Check for a wildcard match:
            * `Test-Path -Path "C:\Users\Username\Documents\*.txt"`
            * This will return $true if there's at least one .txt file in the specified directory.
        * Using with conditional statements:
        ```sh
        if (Test-Path -Path "C:\Users\Username\Documents\example.txt") {
            Write-Host "File exists!"
        } else {
            Write-Host "File does not exist."
        }
        ```
    * Parameters:
        * -Path: Specifies the path to be tested. You can also pipe a path to Test-Path.
        * -LiteralPath: Like -Path, but doesn't recognize characters like * or ? as wildcards.
        * -IsValid: Returns $true if the path is syntactically valid, regardless of whether the items exist.
        * -PathType: Tests the type of item at the path. Valid values are Any, Container, and Leaf. "Container" generally refers to directories, and "Leaf" refers to files.
    * This cmdlet is especially useful for ensuring a file or directory's existence before trying operations that might fail or produce errors if the item doesn't exist.

* How to create a MiniDump for a process when it crashes ?
  * [Arnavion/crashdump: An example of an out-of-process crash dumper](https://github.com/Arnavion/crashdump)
    * Demonstrates how to have a C process (crasher.exe) have a stack trace and minidump taken if it crashes. Both are done by another process (dumper.exe), which is crucial to getting a dump with a sane stack trace.
    * crasher registers an exception handler with SetUnhandledExceptionFilter. This handler starts dumper and waits for it to exit. It passes its process ID, thread ID, and exception pointers (containing the context record) to dumper in the commandline. The exception pointer is useful because it contains the context of the original exception instead of the current context (inside the exception handler). crasher then waits for dumper to finish (but see miscellaneous 1 below).
    * On startup, dumper use the process and thread IDs from its commandline to open handles to crasher. Then it uses some calls to ReadProcessMemory to fetch dumper's exception pointers and context record. It then uses this context record to set up the original stack frame and starts walking the stack using StackWalk64. It also uses the Sym* API to load crasher's PDB and other PDBs so that it can print function names, and parameter names and values for each frame. This verbose code is under printStack(), and is mostly composed of interpreting the types of the function parameters and extracting their values into human-readable form.
    * Lastly, dumper uses MiniDumpWriteDump to write a minidump.
    * The motivation to have a stack printer separate from a minidump writer is to cover the cases where the user of crasher may be concerned about private data in the dump that they would not like to share with you. With a textual stack trace, they can vet it to strip private data before sending it to you.

    * Not all bugs can be found prior to release, which means not all bugs that throw exceptions can be found before release. Fortunately, Microsoft has included in the Platform SDK a function to help developers collect information on exceptions that are discovered by users. The MiniDumpWriteDump function writes the necessary crash dump information to a file without saving the whole process space. This crash dump information file is called a minidump. This technical article provides info about how to write and use a minidump.

  * You can simply use the Win32 API CreateFile and then specify no sharing rights. This will ensure that no other processes can access the file.
  * The dwShareMode DWORD specifies the type of sharing you would like, for example GENERIC_READ. If you specify 0 then that means no sharing rights should be granted.
  ```c++
  HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(_T("c:\\file.txt"), GENERIC_READ, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
  ```
  * If you want to only lock a certain part of the file you can use LockFile or LockFileEx.
  ```c++
  //Lock the first 1024 bytes
  BOOL bLocked = LockFile(hFile, 0, 0, 1024, 0);
